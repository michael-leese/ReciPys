Third Milestone Project - Data Centric Development

This project has bought together all the knowledge learnt in the Python and Data Centric Modules that have been covered.  

I have created a recipe storage website utilising the services of Heroku and Mongo DB. 

ReciPy's is the website that allows users to search through all the recipes in our database and see short descriptions of the recipes with an image, to get inspiration. If the user registers they are able to view the full recipe and get the ingredients and instructions to make the meal of their choice.  
The users can add their own recipe to the database, which will be stored in their own dictionary(or Cookopedia) for later so they can quickly see their own recipes. They can edit and delete their own recipes, but dont have the facility to carry out these tasks on anyone elses recipes.

The deployed website is [ReciPys](https://recipys.herokuapp.com).
